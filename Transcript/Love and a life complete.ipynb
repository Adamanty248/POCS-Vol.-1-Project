    "(GE): Lauree knew how to tease me without my being offended. And there was something about the way she would smile that, you know, I can still see very vividly. She was the first person I really, truly loved. But I grew up in the 40s in a small, rural community. There were certainly no role models of what it means to love someone of the same sex. So, I didn’t know how to understand that.\n",

    "During all of this time, Lauree and I had stayed in touch. I knew that I loved her deeply. She said, “Well, I have very strong feelings for you too but most of all I want to have children.” She met a man who had asked her to marry him. Then she got pregnant and she said, ”If it’s a little girl, I’m going to name her after you.” Well, it turned out it was a little boy and I was relieved. It really would have been excruciatingly painful if she had had a little girl named after me.\n",

    "\n",
    "At StoryCorps, Liz and Lori sat down to remember their whirlwind teenage romance….\n",
    "\n",
    "Liz Barnez (LB): So we were growing up good Catholic girls and, uh, we played sports against each other. And a big group of us would go out and we’d all dance together and, I don’t know, there was just an attraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lori Daigle (LD): Yes, I remember that too. I actually remember that first kiss. We drove out to the parking lot of Lake Pontchartrain and I remember never being so afraid and so excited in my entire life.\n",
    "\n",
    "LB: And then we never talked about it with each other even. So you went off to college.\n",

    "LD: Yeah, I went off to college.\n",
    "\n",
    "LB: And I stayed in New Orleans. Went to UNO. We lost touch.\n",
    "\n",
    "LD: Mmhm… I let my parents know at nineteen and that’s when, um, my father and mom decided that, uh, they didn’t want me to come back to the house. I knew what I wanted and I knew who I wanted to be but: How do I get back into my family? The answer to that was to get married to a man and have children and that’s what I did for 17 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "I felt love and I felt companionship but that feeling that I had for you—that crazy, chaotic excitement—I just didn’t feel that.\n",
    "\n",
    "LB: Yeah…\n",

    "LD: I had been divorced for two weeks and I was just going to be single for the rest of my life and then you and I reconnected on Facebook. And all the old memories, all the old feelings, everything just came flooding back.\n",
    "\n",
    "LB: So 28 years later, or longer than that, after the first kiss, you came out to Colorado to visit.\n",
    "\n",
    "LD: And I just saw you and all I wanted to do was kiss you again.\n",
    "\n",

    "Joey Jefferson is a Missions Operations Engineer at NASA… he’s spent a lifetime learning about the stars… a passion which came in awfully handy on his first date with Wilford Lenov… who speaks first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wilford Lenov (WL): I remember you picking me up and I was so nervous. You asked, ”Where do you want to go?” I said, ”We should go somewhere you and I don’t even know.” We went to Hermosa Beach I remember, and it was beautiful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Joey Jefferson (JJ): The stars were out…\n",
    "\n",
    "WL: And we were just walking, and we saw that bench.\n",
    "\n",
    "JJ: One of the people that were in the Challenger disaster, it was a dedication to him.\n",
    "\n",
    "WL: And I can tell in that moment — you have this look on your face like, ”Oh, I got this.” You’re like ‘Look at the stars. Do you know what that is?”\n",
    "\n",
    "JJ: I know exactly what I said. I said, ”You know, the nearest star is 4.2 light years away. It’s called Proxima Centauri. If you’re traveling at the speed of light, which is 186,000 miles per second, the distance you travel is a light year. So every single light went 50,000 years unobstructed to hit right into your eye.”\n",
    "\n",
    "WL: I just remember looking at you and I was like, ”Oh, my God. This is it,” like, ”This is the guy.”\n",
    "\n",
    "JJ: I was actually nervous because I wasn’t sure if I was, like, completely ready to be in a relationship with someone who I thought was so amazing, because I have issues with depression and it was very exciting but yet very scary.\n",
    "\n",
    "WL: When I saw you broken—two months after we met—you would be like, ”You can leave.” And I was like, ”No, I’m not leaving.”\n",
    "\n",
    "JJ: It was a life or death situation. At some points I didn’t want to tell you how dark it got. A lot of people would not deal with that.\n",
    "\n",
    "WL: You were scared to talk about it with anybody and I’m very grateful that you put that trust in me. I feel like you just needed to have someone hug you and be like, ”It’s okay.”\n",
    "\n",
    "JJ: Your insistence, your love, your everything—you just didn’t give up. And I will always forever be thankful to you for that, always.\n",
    "\n",
    "WL: The closest thing that us humans have to magic is love, because with love it’s about faith, it’s about, you know, trusting one another, and… you’re my magic.\n",

    "JB: Yeah…\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
