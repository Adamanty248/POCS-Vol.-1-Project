Like, telling me one day that, “Kids really can fly, but you have to really trust.” So we went on that rickety swing set, and I remember you pushing me, saying, ‘Now jump, and think of a happy thought.’ And I screamed out ‘Pizza.’ And I…I fell into mom’s rosebush. And your response to me was, ‘Oh, because you’re so fat, you should have said two happy thoughts.’\n",

And I said, “I was always envious of you as a kid.” And you were like, so quiet. You said, ‘I’ve always been jealous of you. Everyone wants to be your best friend, and I scare people.’\n",
    "\n",
    "DS: I think, when you’re faced with your mortality, I began to take the meaningful things in my life more seriously. I remember, we were just getting ready to go into Nasiriyah, and a reporter had a global cell phone, and I said, ‘Do you mind if I make a call on that?’\n",

    "Back in 1994, Lisa Garzone married the then love of her life, John Joyce. Here she is talking about their relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lisa Garzone (LG): He was the father of my four children and, at one point, my best friend. But John became alcoholic and things got volatile, so we had to have him leave. And he stopped showing up for visits. I tried to follow where he was and I knew that he was homeless — that just always worried me. I didn’t want him to die on the streets. \n",
    "\n",
    "KK: John eventually got back on his feet. In 2007, he met Megan Smith. At the time, they were both working in homeless advocacy in Rhode Island, and they ended up falling in love. \n",
    "\n",
    "John died from cancer in 2013. But in his death, a new friendship was born between the two women who loved him the most. Megan starts the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Megan Smith (MS): I met John while he was homeless and you guys hadn’t been in contact for a bit of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "LG: It had been eleven or twelve years.\n",
    "\n",
    "MS: But it was a different place and time in his life. He was sober and about that time he got an apartment. But then he found out that he had cancer. And I met you the day before John died. The reason I didn’t reach out to you sooner was because John didn’t want to do more harm.\n",
    "\n",
    "LG: I was scared to meet you because I didn’t know what to expect. And I can remember just looking at him and having great sadness. And I kissed him on the forehead, told him that I loved him, and I whispered in his ear that I forgave him. After that it was all about you, not John, because you were losing the man that you loved.\n",
    "\n",
    "MS: We had a memorial service and you invited me to sit with you and the children. And it was hard, I’m sure, to hear everyone speak positive because you knew another component. But when we got up at the end of the service, your daughter reached out and locked elbows with me.\n",
    "\n",
    "LG: Yes, she did.\n",
    "\n",
    "MS: And we walked out of the church, arm-in-arm. And then, I forget which of us reached out to the other one but said, ”You know, we should get together soon.”\n",
    "\n",
    "LG: We went out to dinner.\n",
    "\n",
    "MS: Then we sat in the car and talked for like another three hours or something.\n",
    "\n",
    "LG: Yeah. It was pouring rain out, we got out of the car so I could have a cigarette and then in the pouring rain we just hugged. And I just said, ”I hope that you’ll be a part of our lives.” And you have been ever since.\n",
    "\n",
    "<MUSIC>\n",
    "\n",
    "KK: That was Lisa Garzone and Megan Smith in 2014.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before John died, he helped pass a homeless bill of rights in Rhode Island. The law prevents governments, health care workers, employers, and others from treating people who are homeless unfairly because of their housing status.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our final story starts in Sing Sing prison in 1998. That’s where Robert Sanchez first met Fred Davie. Robert was serving 15 years for a first time, non-violent drug offense. This was an extremely harsh sentence but it was really common under New York’s Rockefeller Drug Laws. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fred Davie was a minister at the time. The prison had just started a graduate program and Robert was studying to get his Masters in theology.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2016, they came to StoryCorps to remember the first time Fred visited his class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Robert Sanchez (RS): We met at Sing Sing in this small windowless room…\n",
    "\n",
    "Fred Davie (FD): Yeah exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "RS: …which didn’t look like much of an educational setting… (Laughs)\n",
    "\n",
    "FD: I know… (Laughs)\n",
    "\n",
    "RS: But that room created magic. I think it was 16 men, most of us were there for about 15-20 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "FD: I remember being impressed at how well-read you guys were.\n",
    "\n",
    "RS: Fred, we ain’t have much else to do. (Laughs)\n",
    "\n",
    "FD: (Laughs) I remember that you said that you had no arrests prior, nothing in your system, and nothing on you, and you got 15 years to life for a non-violent drug charge. But I thought, he’s making that up.\n",
    "\n",
    "RS: It can’t be possible. (Laughs)\n",
    "\n",
    "FD: (Laughs) It can’t be possible. Right…\n",
    "\n",
    "RS: I think I survived it by always having hope. What is life without hope? Even an iota of light can go a long way. And my first impression of you was, here’s this beautiful kind man who, for whatever reason, just represents hope to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "FD: All these years I never knew this had that much impact on you.\n",
    "\n",
    "RS: Oh it did Fred, it did.\n",
    "\n",
    "FD: Huh…\n",
    "\n",
    "RS: I’ve been home for 16 years now.\n",
    "\n",
    "FD: Yep.\n",
    "\n",
    "RS: When I came home I was so afraid, but I knew that I can pick up the phone and tell you, “Fred, I don’t get this shit.”\n",
    "\n",
    "FD: Right. (Laughs)\n",
    "\n",
    "RS: I could just ask the dumbest questions ever…\n",
    "\n",
    "FD: (Laughs)\n",
    "\n",
    "RS: …but you never told me they were dumb.\n",
    "\n",
    "FD: For me, I had people in my corner every step of the way. My dad wasn’t there, but if things messed up, no matter where I was, I could always go to my mother’s front porch, and know that I was welcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "RS: I have that from you, but I didn’t have that from anywhere else, so…\n",
    "\n",
    "FD: Understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "RS: You know it’s weird because I’m not your son…\n",
    "\n",
    "FD: Right. (Laughs)\n",
    "\n",
    "RS: …but, you know, I didn’t grow up with a father neither. My father died from an overdose. So I saw you as, like, if I had a dad, if I had somebody that was going to guide me, that was you.\n",
    "\n",
    "FD: Wow, thank you. Most folks who’ve been through what you’ve been through don’t get this far.\n",
    "\n",
    "RS: Yeah, I’ve got to be reminded every now and then. There are times that I get bitter and angry at my situation. I live a pretty lonely life, and if I’m not careful, I can fall into these doldrums. But just you being there, to be able to listen to me; and say, “You know what, you’re going to be okay.” It’s a tremendous gift, and I’m a lucky man."

    "Our final story starts in Sing Sing prison in 1998. That’s where Robert Sanchez first met Fred Davie. Robert was serving 15 years for a first time, non-violent drug offense. This was an extremely harsh sentence but it was really common under New York’s Rockefeller Drug Laws. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fred Davie was a minister at the time. The prison had just started a graduate program and Robert was studying to get his Masters in theology.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2016, they came to StoryCorps to remember the first time Fred visited his class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Robert Sanchez (RS): We met at Sing Sing in this small windowless room…\n",
    "\n",
    "Fred Davie (FD): Yeah exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "RS: …which didn’t look like much of an educational setting… (Laughs)\n",
    "\n",
    "FD: I know… (Laughs)\n",
    "\n",
    "RS: But that room created magic. I think it was 16 men, most of us were there for about 15-20 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "FD: I remember being impressed at how well-read you guys were.\n",
    "\n",
    "RS: Fred, we ain’t have much else to do. (Laughs)\n",
    "\n",
    "FD: (Laughs) I remember that you said that you had no arrests prior, nothing in your system, and nothing on you, and you got 15 years to life for a non-violent drug charge. But I thought, he’s making that up.\n",
    "\n",
    "RS: It can’t be possible. (Laughs)\n",
    "\n",
    "FD: (Laughs) It can’t be possible. Right…\n",
    "\n",
    "RS: I think I survived it by always having hope. What is life without hope? Even an iota of light can go a long way. And my first impression of you was, here’s this beautiful kind man who, for whatever reason, just represents hope to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "FD: All these years I never knew this had that much impact on you.\n",
    "\n",
    "RS: Oh it did Fred, it did.\n",
    "\n",
    "FD: Huh…\n",
    "\n",
    "RS: I’ve been home for 16 years now.\n",
    "\n",
    "FD: Yep.\n",
    "\n",
    "RS: When I came home I was so afraid, but I knew that I can pick up the phone and tell you, “Fred, I don’t get this shit.”\n",
    "\n",
    "FD: Right. (Laughs)\n",
    "\n",
    "RS: I could just ask the dumbest questions ever…\n",
    "\n",
    "FD: (Laughs)\n",
    "\n",
    "RS: …but you never told me they were dumb.\n",
    "\n",
    "FD: For me, I had people in my corner every step of the way. My dad wasn’t there, but if things messed up, no matter where I was, I could always go to my mother’s front porch, and know that I was welcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "RS: I have that from you, but I didn’t have that from anywhere else, so…\n",
    "\n",
    "FD: Understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "RS: You know it’s weird because I’m not your son…\n",
    "\n",
    "FD: Right. (Laughs)\n",
    "\n",
    "RS: …but, you know, I didn’t grow up with a father neither. My father died from an overdose. So I saw you as, like, if I had a dad, if I had somebody that was going to guide me, that was you.\n",
    "\n",
    "FD: Wow, thank you. Most folks who’ve been through what you’ve been through don’t get this far.\n",
    "\n",
    "RS: Yeah, I’ve got to be reminded every now and then. There are times that I get bitter and angry at my situation. I live a pretty lonely life, and if I’m not careful, I can fall into these doldrums. But just you being there, to be able to listen to me; and say, “You know what, you’re going to be okay.” It’s a tremendous gift, and I’m a lucky man."
