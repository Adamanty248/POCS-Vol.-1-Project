After the break, we’ll hear from someone who cares for people at the other end of their lives. Stay with us.KK: We just heard about Granny Hayden, whose hands brought hundreds of lives into the world, welcoming them as they took their first breath. Now, we’re going to hear from someone who’s there for people when they take their last.Hajime Koyama, who goes by Issan, came to StoryCorps to talk about how he became a hospice worker. It all starts with the memory of his grandmother, who taught him about death for the first time, when he was growing up in Japan.Hajime Issan Koyama (HIK): I had my favorite grandmother who was really eccentric woman. She built her living room in the French rococo style, and she slept on bed instead of a futon, and she had a chandelier instead of a Japanese style floor lamp. And I know she was a little strange to the other people but somehow, I loved this lady.When I was five years old, she had a few strokes and she was bedridden. I was playing in her room with my toys, as I always did. And then she says, ‘Hajime, keep it down.’ And I said, ‘yes,’ and I kept on talking to myself and playing with my toys. And then suddenly, door swings open and I was basically pulled out from the room and I was told my grandmother died while I was with her all alone, playing on the floor at the foot of her bed. But the memory of that afternoon stuck with me because it was a beautiful afternoon. The sun comes in through the window and I felt so warm and protected and very peaceful. And then, when I was a teenager, my father died. He was sick with cancer. I think it was my mother came to me and says, ‘We need a little break. Can you sit with your father?’ So I said, ‘Of course, sure.’ And in Japan, parents don’t really touch kids, particularly father-son don’t really touch or hug. But before he died, he started to move his hand and arm toward me. So I held his hand. And eventually I held him in my arms. He looked at me and took three separate exhale with a long pause in between his final breath. It’s a strange thing to say, but it was so beautiful. And though it feels very deep and almost dangerous, it was a really wonderful feeling, like the depth of this unknown at the bottom of the ocean. And so, by diving right into it, I really understood that incredible sense of intimacy. So there are plenty of death around me in my early years. But, you know, the foundation of my hospice work has been deeply rooted by what I experienced in my years to follow afterward.KK: In the early 1980s, Issan moved to the US. He got really involved in the fashion, culture and entertainment industry. And then a lot of his friends and colleagues started to get sick.HIK: I found myself in epicenter of AIDS epidemic. It was a really surreal time. One after another, all these beautiful men and women started to shrivel up and die. And I started to feel this accumulated secondary grief from the death I experienced, and I really needed some sort of resources from somebody who knows this probably better than myself. KK: This is when Issan heard about a Buddhist Priest in San Francisco. His name was Issan Dorsey. Issan means one mountain; keep that in mind.HIK: So one day he sees somebody who is homeless and dying with AIDS on the street. He just can’t leave him alone. And he picks this guy up and brings him home. And the next day, he brings another one, and another one comes, and another one comes. So eventually, this temple or meditation center became one of America’s first AIDS-specific hospice. And I really felt very touched when I heard about this guy’s story. So one day I just decided to buy the ticket and I went to San Francisco. I saw the sign that says, Temple of Issan; Isaanji. And I immediately broke down at the door and then this guy gently ushers me into the living room and he sits and patiently listens to me for a long time. And he says, ‘I am so sorry you didn’t know Issan had also died of AIDS and I take care of this place now.‘This morning, a guy upstairs just checked out. And if you want to, you can stay in that room and you can learn how to take care of the people who are dying of AIDS.’ And I said yes. So later on, when I became a Buddhist priest, someone who ordained me gave me the name Issan. So I’m a little, small, Issan [Laughs]. I’m a small one mountain.KK: Thinking about being surrounded by so much death, would probably make most of us feel sad, but that’s not what Issan would want you to take away from his story.HIK: We are all together in this painful world, but because of that, this really organic, deep seated sense of compassion arises that puts us together. And in the midst of the chaos and pain and the suffering, that is exactly where the very very pure white flower of compassion arises and blossoms. Nowhere else but in the muddy water.
