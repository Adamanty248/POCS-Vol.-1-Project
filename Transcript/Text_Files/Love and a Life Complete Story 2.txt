Next, a love story that takes a different path….It was the spring of 1981 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Liz Barnez was 16, and Lori Daigle, 17. Both played softball for their respective high schools. Despite the competition on the field… off the field… the pair felt an immediate spark….At StoryCorps, Liz and Lori sat down to remember their whirlwind teenage romance….Liz Barnez (LB): So we were growing up good Catholic girls and, uh, we played sports against each other. And a big group of us would go out and we’d all dance together and, I don’t know, there was just an attraction.Lori Daigle (LD): Yes, I remember that too. I actually remember that first kiss. We drove out to the parking lot of Lake Pontchartrain and I remember never being so afraid and so excited in my entire life.LB: And then we never talked about it with each other even. So you went off to college.LD: Yeah, I went off to college.LB: And I stayed in New Orleans. Went to UNO. We lost touch.LD: Mmhm… I let my parents know at nineteen and that’s when, um, my father and mom decided that, uh, they didn’t want me to come back to the house. I knew what I wanted and I knew who I wanted to be but: How do I get back into my family? The answer to that was to get married to a man and have children and that’s what I did for 17 years.I felt love and I felt companionship but that feeling that I had for you—that crazy, chaotic excitement—I just didn’t feel that.LB: Yeah….LD: I had been divorced for two weeks and I was just going to be single for the rest of my life and then you and I reconnected on Facebook. And all the old memories, all the old feelings, everything just came flooding back.LB: So 28 years later, or longer than that, after the first kiss, you came out to Colorado to visit.LD: And I just saw you and all I wanted to do was kiss you again.LB: And that was even better. We had learned how to kiss over the years. Laughs.LD: Had a little more confidence.Both: Laughter.LB: Yes and your parents came around.LD: My mom got to see me being happy and me….LB: …before she passed away.LD: Yep… And last letter she ever wrote me was I am so happy that you are finally getting to be you.JM: That’s Lori Daigle with her wife, Liz Barnez, at the StoryCorps MobileBooth in Fort Collins, Colorado….Liz and Lori were married on July 26th, 2015… more than 30 years after that first kiss…. and about a month after the Supreme Court legalized marriage for same-sex couples in all 50 states.
