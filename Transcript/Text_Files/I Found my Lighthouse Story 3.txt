KK: Welcome back.Back in 1994, Lisa Garzone married the then love of her life, John Joyce. Here she is talking about their relationship.Lisa Garzone (LG): He was the father of my four children and, at one point, my best friend. But John became alcoholic and things got volatile, so we had to have him leave. And he stopped showing up for visits. I tried to follow where he was and I knew that he was homeless — that just always worried me. I didn’t want him to die on the streets. KK: John eventually got back on his feet. In 2007, he met Megan Smith. At the time, they were both working in homeless advocacy in Rhode Island, and they ended up falling in love. John died from cancer in 2013. But in his death, a new friendship was born between the two women who loved him the most. Megan starts the conversation.Megan Smith (MS): I met John while he was homeless and you guys hadn’t been in contact for a bit of time.LG: It had been eleven or twelve years.MS: But it was a different place and time in his life. He was sober and about that time he got an apartment. But then he found out that he had cancer. And I met you the day before John died. The reason I didn’t reach out to you sooner was because John didn’t want to do more harm.LG: I was scared to meet you because I didn’t know what to expect. And I can remember just looking at him and having great sadness. And I kissed him on the forehead, told him that I loved him, and I whispered in his ear that I forgave him. After that it was all about you, not John, because you were losing the man that you loved.MS: We had a memorial service and you invited me to sit with you and the children. And it was hard, I’m sure, to hear everyone speak positive because you knew another component. But when we got up at the end of the service, your daughter reached out and locked elbows with me.LG: Yes, she did.MS: And we walked out of the church, arm-in-arm. And then, I forget which of us reached out to the other one but said, ”You know, we should get together soon.”LG: We went out to dinner.MS: Then we sat in the car and talked for like another three hours or something.LG: Yeah. It was pouring rain out, we got out of the car so I could have a cigarette and then in the pouring rain we just hugged. And I just said, ”I hope that you’ll be a part of our lives.” And you have been ever since.KK: That was Lisa Garzone and Megan Smith in 2014.Before John died, he helped pass a homeless bill of rights in Rhode Island. The law prevents governments, health care workers, employers, and others from treating people who are homeless unfairly because of their housing status.
