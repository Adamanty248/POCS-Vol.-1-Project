Our first story comes from 90-year-old Mary Othella Burnette. She wanted to remember her grandmother, Mary Stepp Burnette Hayden, who was an herbalist and midwife from Southern Appalachia. Mary spoke with her daughter, Debora Palmer.DP: What was your relationship with her like, Mom? MB: She delivered me. She used to tell me how I startled her and my dad a few minutes after I was born by opening my eyes and turning my head to look around the room. And she said, ‘God, look at that.’ My grandmother loved to talk and most of her stories were bad. Laughs. But Granny’s stories were real life stories. She didn’t know anything about Hansel and Gretel.DB: Can you paint a picture of Grandma Mary Hayden?MB: She had deep set eyes, and a fierce look, as if she were looking right through you. She probably weighed not more than 110 pounds. She was about four feet, 11 inches tall, but she could chop her own wood when she was 90 years old, and she could thread a needle without using glasses.DP: And how did she dress?MB: She usually wore a dark colored dress of some kind and always had a large white homemade apron. She had very long hair. Very straight and it hung well below her waist. She would ask me to comb her hair and I would have to keep backing up because it was  so long. She liked her hair pulled back tight and she would ball it at the back of her neck. But on one particular occasion, she probably hastily pinned up a braid and she had gone blackberry picking and this black rope fell down across her shoulder and she thought: ‘Oh, my. I’m being attacked by a snake’. And she’s telling that story, and she claps her hands and she says, ‘Gentlemen, it was just a plait of my hair.’ MB: That’s one of her good stories.DP: Chuckles.KK: Mary Stepp Burnette Hayden, or Granny Hayden as her family calls her, was born into slavery in Black Mountain, North Carolina. And her mother was the plantation midwife.MB: The only memory she ever shared with me about her life on the plantation was listening to the Emancipation Proclamation being read by a man seated on a horse in front of her mother’s cabin. And she always referred to the Emancipation Proclamation as ‘that paper’. She wasn’t excited about it, because it didn’t mean anything to the people in Black Mountain. There was no union officer at the Stepp plantation to enforce it. So they had to stay there another two years until the Civil War ended.KK: Granny Hayden was seven when she left the plantation, in 1865. She learned herbalism and midwifery from her mother, and eventually started practicing it herself.MB: Here was this woman, a former slave, walking around delivering babies, and helping people.You have to understand that back when Granny started, there were no hospitals for Black people to go to, and poor people had no money to pay for professional medical care. So if you had a disease that could not be treated by a midwife, you died at home. Black Mountain is woods land and houses could be several miles apart, and bears commonly roved the neighborhoods. But she walked. If somebody needed help — Granny was going. Black and whites alike, it made no difference to her. DP: Can you tell me the story about the mountain lion? MB: Well, we didn’t say mountain lion, it’s the same thing, but we said catamount; cat of the mountain. And they were common in those days. She would be coming home at night. And people had no money, so sometimes they paid her what they called ‘in-kind,’ like a big slab of pork. And that would be her pay. So this catamount would pick up that scent and start to stalk her. But Granny was fearless. She would do what she had to do. KK: And here’s what she did. First of all, she wore lots of layers of clothing. She had a bunch of petticoats, a bonnet, and the large white apron Mary remembers her with. And she would start pulling off garments and throwing them on the trail, hoping the mountain lion would stop long enough to smell and tear up that garment before moving on. That gave her a little more time to run and get home safely. And she did this for decades. DP: What would you say was the biggest obstacle Granny Hayden overcame in life? MB: I think the greatest obstacle was having to give up her practice because there was this new law that stopped her from practicing. To get a letter in the mail one day saying, this will now be done by medical doctors, that must have been an awful slap in the face. I mean, she’s done this all her life. That’s what she knows. But, you know, people would still send for her. She did not break the laws, but when a baby was going to be born, she would be at that bedside.One day, somebody came to Granny for help with a sick child. Granny knew she was not supposed to treat that sick child, so she went to that woman’s house and told her which herb to find and told her how to prepare it. The lady did as my grandmother told her to do, and the child got well. So she was working around these laws.KK: Even though it got more difficult for Granny Hayden to practice, the family remembers her eventually becoming one of the first Black midwives to be legally-registered in the area.MB: You know, she never boasted about what she did, but she probably caught several hundred babies, if not more. DP: How old was Granny Hayden when she stopped her practice? MB: She was about 90 years old. She was a very strong little woman. You know, when people think about slavery, they think about hundreds of years ago, not about somebody who died in 1956. These things are important for people to be awakened to history.DP: So what image of her persists in your mind today?MB: A little woman in a dark dress and white apron. Sitting on her porch. Looking off into the distance and patting her foot. And behind her are herbs tacked to the wall of the porch. She was a pillar, not only in our family, but in our community. And I assumed she would always be there; like when you’re a child, you assume everything’s going to be there. But I am very proud to have descended from someone like my grandmother. Very, very proud.KK: That’s Mary Othella Burnette and her daughter, Debora Palmer, remembering their grandmother and great-grandmother, Mary Stepp Burnette Hayden. Granny Hayden died right at the dawn of the civil rights era at 98 years old.
