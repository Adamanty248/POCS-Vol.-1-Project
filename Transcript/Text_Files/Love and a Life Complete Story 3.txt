Next… we’ll hear from a NASA engineer whose love story was… quite literally… written in the stars….JM: Welcome back….Joey Jefferson is a Missions Operations Engineer at NASA… he’s spent a lifetime learning about the stars… a passion which came in awfully handy on his first date with Wilford Lenov… who speaks first.Wilford Lenov (WL): I remember you picking me up and I was so nervous. You asked, ”Where do you want to go?” I said, ”We should go somewhere you and I don’t even know.” We went to Hermosa Beach I remember, and it was beautiful.Joey Jefferson (JJ): The stars were out….WL: And we were just walking, and we saw that bench.JJ: One of the people that were in the Challenger disaster, it was a dedication to him.WL: And I can tell in that moment — you have this look on your face like, ”Oh, I got this.” You’re like ‘Look at the stars. Do you know what that is?”JJ: I know exactly what I said. I said, ”You know, the nearest star is 4.2 light years away. It’s called Proxima Centauri. If you’re traveling at the speed of light, which is 186,000 miles per second, the distance you travel is a light year. So every single light went 50,000 years unobstructed to hit right into your eye.”WL: I just remember looking at you and I was like, ”Oh, my God. This is it,” like, ”This is the guy.”JJ: I was actually nervous because I wasn’t sure if I was, like, completely ready to be in a relationship with someone who I thought was so amazing, because I have issues with depression and it was very exciting but yet very scary.WL: When I saw you broken—two months after we met—you would be like, ”You can leave.” And I was like, ”No, I’m not leaving.”JJ: It was a life or death situation. At some points I didn’t want to tell you how dark it got. A lot of people would not deal with that.WL: You were scared to talk about it with anybody and I’m very grateful that you put that trust in me. I feel like you just needed to have someone hug you and be like, ”It’s okay.”JJ: Your insistence, your love, your everything—you just didn’t give up. And I will always forever be thankful to you for that, always.WL: The closest thing that us humans have to magic is love, because with love it’s about faith, it’s about, you know, trusting one another, and… you’re my magic.JJ: I love you so much.WL: I love you too, baby.JM: That’s Wilford Lenov speaking with his partner Joey Jefferson at StoryCorps in Los Angeles, California.Our last story comes from a couple who proves it’s never too late to say ‘I do…’.Born in 1918… John Banvard, a World War II veteran… thought he’d seen and done it all. But then… he met Vietnam veteran Jerry Nadeau (nuh-DOE)… and the rest, as they say, was history….Jerry Nadeau (JN): So I start with my name and all that stuff? Okay, we’ll see how it works. Hello! My name is Jerry Nadeau. I’m with John Banvard.John Banvard (JB): And I was born in Brooklyn, New York….JN: No, no, no, no… You’ve gotta say your name and everything. ’Hello, my name is…’.JB: Hello, my name is John Banvard. I am 100 years of age.JN: When I first met you, John, you were 75 years old. What would it have been like if you didn’t meet me?JB: I would’ve continued being lonely. I’d been absolutely lost.JN: When we met, we were sort of in the closet.JB: Yeah….JN: And I never had a real relationship. Now we’ve been together almost 25 years. And when we moved into the veterans home, we moved in together. And a lot of people were wondering, ’I wonder what their relationship is?’JB: Yes….JN: Well, when we got married they knew what our relationship was. [Laughs]JB: I was expecting we’d be ridiculed and there was very little of that.JN: We got married at the veterans home and we said, ’If you came to see the bride, you’re out of luck.’ Do you remember that? [Laughs]JB: Yes, of course.JN: It was very informal.JB: It was done simply, yes.JN: We served hot dogs.JB: Which is hardly wedding food….JN: Remember, John, I was with you in the cafeteria and somebody came up and they were with their family and they said, ’Oh, this is Gerard Nadeau and this is his husband, John.’ I had never heard that before.JB: Yeah… That was very nice.JN: You’ve made my life complete.JB: I could say the same thing to you. I think we’re probably as happy together as any two people you’re likely to meet.
