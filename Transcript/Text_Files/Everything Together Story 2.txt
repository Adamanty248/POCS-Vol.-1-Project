We’re listening to conversations between kids and parents who have leaned on each other, especially through big life moments.Like Kaysen Ford and Jennifer Sumner, who first came to StoryCorps in 2015 when Kaysen was 12 years old.Jennifer Sumner (JS): Tell us a little bit about yourself.Kaysen Ford: I am a martial artist. I play the stand up bass. I am learning how to play the guitar. And I am transgender.JS: What level are you in martial arts.KF: I’m a level two blue belt. That means I’m halfway to black belt.JS: What is your favorite subject in school.KF: PE.JS: PE.KF: Or lunch.JS: What grade level were you in school when you decided to tell your friends and family that you were transgender.KF: It was around fifth grade when I told my friends and family I was transgender because up until then, I did not know that the word existed. It was misery every day. I hated being called a girl. I hated being called a daughter. But most everybody…my family, friends, they were just…okay. Because they kind of knew it was coming.JS: Yeah.KF: Over the summer, I went to art camp. And they did not know I was transgender. They just called me ‘he’. And that was awesome.I think the happiest moment in my life would probably be January 16th, 2015, 8:45 PM. You bought me boxer pants.JS: You’d been telling me for quite a while that you wanted boxers. You were wearing all boy clothes. Getting boy haircuts. And that was like the final change. And you were just ecstatic.KF: That was awesome.JS: Is there anything else you would like for people to know about you.KF: Well, even though I’m transgender, I’m a kid too. I have homework to deal with…I have tests to deal with.JS: I have been extremely proud of you because you have been true to who you are. And you’re very courageous.KF: It shouldn’t be scary to be who you are. I mean, maybe a little bit at first. But it’s way happier this way. Trust me.JS: I don’t think you realize what a leader you are. People look up to you because you are not afraid to take a different path and we know that it’s your life and you’re the one that’s got to live it but we are there for you every single step of the way. And we’re going to do whatever we can to…to lighten your load. I’m very proud to be your mom.KF: I’m proud to be your son.JS: Laughs.KK: That’s Kaysen Ford and Jennifer Sumner in Birmingham, Alabama in 2015. Today, Kaysen and Jennifer are in a similar spot to Sylvia and her dad Josh.Kaysen is 19 and also starting college. But before they left, they had an opportunity to record another StoryCorps conversation with their mom, Jennifer, to talk about what’s changed since their last interview.Kaysen Ford (KF): I’ve definitely become more mature, but that’s bound to happen when you go from 12 to almost 19. And now I’m graduating and planning for life and stuff. How are you feeling about that. Jennifer Sumner (JS): Oh boy, I am excited for your future. I sometimes want you to be a little baby again so I could just hold you and rock you. But I’m very glad that you have reached some milestones that, to be quite honest, I was afraid we weren’t going to reach – you weren’t going to reach.KF: What type of milestones.JS: You had suicidal ideation. Um, there were times that I wasn’t sure how school was going to go because you were so depressed. You were up against so many challenges and yet you stood strong and you were still brave. KF: I didn’t really get a choice. I kind of had to be.JS: Yeah. And and you did it. KF:  Yeah. I graduated.JS: I’m going to cry.KF: I’m trying not to say anything that’ll make you cry, I don’t know, like, my brain really wants to thank you for, like, being in such a supportive parent. I know that parents should be, but still. Thank you.You know, media tends to focus around queer tragedy. And I think that’s why parents have such a hard time accepting. And like, yeah, that stuff is real and it happens, but another real thing is being queer and happy. Being happy is not in spite of being queer. It is a part of it.JS: No matter where life takes you, no matter how far away, I’ll always love you unconditionally.KK: Earlier this month, Kaysen started classes at The University of Alabama at Birmingham, so I called them up to see how things were going.KK: So you said you wanted to stay close to home. You wanted to be close to your mom.KF: Yes, my parents both live in Alabama, so I wanted to stay near nearby. KK: Are you close with your parents.KF: Somewhat. I mean, like about average amount for a 19 year old. KK: Yeah, that’s fair, [laughs] I get that. So, Is there anything that you’re particularly nervous about starting this new chapter.KF: I am nervous about, dorm life because I want to make friends. And also, since I’m trans I’m a little nervous about having a roommate. I told the housing that I’m trans and so they’re trying to find a good roommate for me.KK: That’s good. I hope the person is, like, dope and you guys can hang out and like do roommate stuff.KF: Yeah, I’m excited for that.KK: Are you interested in dating when you get to school.KF: I’m already dating someone. So.KK: AHH. Are you. KF: Yeah.KK: Oh my gosh. Are they also going to UAB. What’s that going to be like. Are you going to be separated. I’m asking so many questions right now. You can stop me whatever you want.KF: You’re good. Um, He doesn’t go to UAB. Uh, he has, like, a job in Birmingham. But I’m excited because he’s going to come visit me sometimes.KK: So you’re going to do, like, weekend, like, date situations.KF: Yeah.KK: So exciting. Oh, my gosh. I’m like shaking. I love this. [laughs] OK, so going off to school is… it’s a big change. Is there advice that you have for someone that might be scared to take that leap.KF: What comforts me about being scared is that so is literally everyone else around you.KK: Yeah. It sounds like you are about to embark on something really exciting.KF: Yes, I think so, too.KK: And you always have people at StoryCorps rooting for you. Don’t forget that.KF: Thank you.KK: Not long after we spoke, Kaysen let me know they were assigned 4 “awesome” suitemates — and they’ve all been getting along great.
