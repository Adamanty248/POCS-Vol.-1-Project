Jade Rone (JR): Nobody asked me how I was feeling. I just felt like I didn’t matter. So, when I was doing bad in school, I kept it to myself.KK: In 2015, Jade was placed with a new foster mom, Stacia Parker. They came to StoryCorps a few years after that to talk about the beginning of their relationship. Stacia Parker (SP): When you came to my house.JR: Mhmm.SP: It was totally different.JR: It was totally different.SP: I knew that you were quiet, and I knew that because you were quiet and petite, that people had not paid attention to you.JR: Mmhmm.SP: You would just say, ‘Mmhmm.’ See how you just said.JR: Mmhmm.SP: You wouldn’t use your words. You had no requests, not even specific food. I said, ‘This is unusual for a teenager.’ So, do you remember the day that you came to me and said, ‘I don’t want to live here?’ Laughs. You told me that the things I wanted from you were impossible.JR: That sounds like something I would say. Laughs.SP: You said that it was no way you were going to learn to make a bed.JR: Clean.SP: Be on time. And I wanted you to continue your violin practice. As an African-American female, society was already going to marginalize you.JR: Right.SP: So, I was trying to develop your voice.JR: You asked me questions about what was going on. You asked me, ‘Ok, so you’re failing this class. So, what we need to do?’ I’m like, ‘What you mean, what we need to do?’ ‘Cause nobody put ‘we’. It was always, ‘You need to fix this.’ I actually remember you taking me back to Girls High. And I cried in the back of your car and I’m like “please don’t make me go back. Anywhere else”. laughs. and you was like “you about to do this”. And they let me back. I think I just needed guidance all around. I didn’t know anything.SP: In terms of what?JR: Employment. Doctors appointments. I didn’t know anything. And then I became a parent young. I didn’t know what that was gonna be like. KK: Jade was 17 when she got pregnant with her daughter, Kalani.It was just a few months after she had moved in with Stacia and learning how to be a mom, while she was still struggling with having a mom. it caused some tension between the two of them.SP: Talk about when Kalani was born.JR: I was terrified. I was just very, very naive. And it kind of didn’t really hit me until it was almost really time for me to have her. SP: Do you think you bonded with her her first six months of life? JR: No. I was still in my teenage phase of me like ‘I could still do what I want to do.’ I don’t think I took the initiative to really be a mom. And when you were telling me this is what you need to do.SP: you resented me for it.JR: I hated you for it. SP: You did. You hated that I developed a relationship with her. One day I went, I’ll go give her a bath. And I know you didn’t want me to touch her.JR:  and about that, it wasn’t that I didn’t want you to touch her. It is that when I came here, you were teaching me so many things and I felt like “I need to show her I can do this without her help”. At the time I thought you were doing it because you thought I couldn’t do it.SP: Absolutely not.JR: But I didn’t know that. SP: But I could have explained or shared more about my thinking. These are the types of things you learn along the way about parenthood, bonding, about falling down and getting back up. JR: Mmhmm. What’s something, um, that you think I’ve taught you?SP: I really used to think that kids came knowing how to communicate. JR: Mmhmm.SP: So when I entered the foster care system that was an area where I needed growth. I had to teach my children how to communicate. And you’ve taught me the power of love. You really helped me see that not only do I know what your needs are, but that I know how to meet them.JR: I’m glad. I want to thank you for everything. Because if you would not have pushed me, I don’t think I would be anywhere near where I am right now. I’ve been searching for a mom all my life. Then I got you and we’ve been it’s been bumpy. Laughs.SP: But, I’ll be here.JR: I know you will.KK: That’s Jade Rone speaking with her mom Stacia Parker in Philly.Jade’s daughter Kalani is now 4 years old and we found out that Jade was actually pregnant during this recording with her second daughter, Nova Reign.
