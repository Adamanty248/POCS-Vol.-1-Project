JW: I remember getting the call from the office, that she had not picked you up… In those first year or two, after mom died. I just remember feeling helpless, you know, like there’s nothing I can do to fix this… Do you remember when I apologized to you. For throwing the note away.SG: For throwing away the note. Yeah, cause I learned that some people write suicide notes and I was like, “where’s mom’s.” I really wanted to read that for a long time. JW: I know, and I felt really bad. But I think I was just so angry when I read that.SG: I mean I totally understand why you did it.JW: Mmhmm. Do you remember how when you were little you would look up at the moon.SG: Yeah.JW: And you would say, “oh mom’s up there on the moon.”SG:  I had this whole story about how she lived in a city on the moon. We had that bathroom window that opened up and didn’t have a screen, and you could see the moon perfectly from there. And so I would look out the window and talk to her. JW: So, what would you want your mom to know about you now.SG: I’d want her to know my personality. And, I would want her to know how tall I am. I’m almost taller than you and I don’t know where I get being tall from. It’s not like our family is giant. JW: I think she would be very proud of you. Is there anything that you’ve learned about yourself.SG: I’ve learned a lot about death and dealing with it because I struggled with that for so long. I couldn’t go to sleep. I didn’t want you to leave because I was worried something would happen. But one time I was at camp and we were supposed to say our biggest fear and I was like “death… hold up, wait… that’s not my biggest fear anymore.”JW: Yeah. SG: So I guess I’m stronger than I think I am. KK: That’s Sylvia Grosvold and her dad, Joshua Weiner, in 2019. The two of them have been really close over the years but with Sylvia starting college, they’re prepping for a new phase in their relationship.So they sat down for another StoryCorps conversation over the summer to talk about what’s next, for both of them. JW: Losing your mom when you were five years old, there was just so much more responsibility on me to take care of you and keep you safe. But now I don’t need to know where you are all the time, or when exactly you’re going to be back, and that’s been hard. And that’ll be hard about you going to college as well.SG: Yeah, but I’m terrified because the longest I’ve been away from home is two weeks. JW: Yeah, but you are going your own way, which is beautiful. You know, there’s nothing good about your mom dying, but our relationship is really special because of that.SG: Yeah, absolutely. We’ve gone through everything together, and we’ve had long conversations about really hard stuff.JW: Yeah, and that’s something that you have in common with your mother. She was like that, too. When she had things that were bothering her, she had to talk about them. Although a big difference is you do a good job of recognizing that you’re not going to be in that place forever and moving forward in a way that she had trouble with. SG: Really.JW: Yeah. What is it that you hope for me now that you’re leaving for school.SG: I mean, you’ve worked really, really hard. As a teacher, you’ve always put your students first and then you were a single parent. So, you deserve some rest and tea on the front porch.JW: [laughs] Thank you. I mean, ever since you were born, you have been the center of my life. Everything I do kind of revolves around taking care of you and making sure you’re okay and stuff like that.  SG: Yeah. What do you think that first night alone is gonna feel like.JW: For you or for me.SG: For you.JW: It’s going to be quiet, which I like. But your presence is gonna be absent and that’s going to be like a little hole in my heart, and it’s gonna feel like there’s a part of me that’s missing.SG: That’s how it’s going to feel for me, too.JW: Mhm. But, wherever I am will hopefully still feel like home to you.KK: That’s Joshua Weiner and his daughter Sylvia Grosvold. Sylvia is now officially a freshman at Ithaca College where she’s studying theater. The first conversation that she and her dad recorded was part of StoryCorps’ Road to Resilience project, which uses storytelling to help children cope with the death of a parent or loved one.
