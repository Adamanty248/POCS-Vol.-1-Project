(EH): We were already anticipating what was gonna happen in this emergency room. Because when he was a little boy, an officer got on his back while he was screaming. And he’s been handcuffed to gurneys in emergency rooms… Keith Miller (KM): Oh, wow.EH: …just for having a seizure and being big. That day, we show up at a hospital — I’m sitting there broken-hearted, scared out of my mind, bleeding. And Walker’s trying to run away. And I see, like, five guys on him and all I can think is “this will not end well”. But suddenly, I hear this cute game.KM: Right laughs.EH: Where he’s trying to escape and you’re going “Walker gets up. Walker sits down. Walker scoots back. Walker lies down.” And then you said, “High fives all around.” And I thought he won’t do it. And I look and he’s beaming. And he’s high fiving every single officer. KM: Mmhmm, mmhmm….EH: And then you started singing…  and I thought I would lose it forever. KM: I started singing Mr Rogers’ neighborhood. EH: You’re singing Mr. Rogers with these men. And he went from being terrified to feeling like he had cool friends, cool guys hanging out with him.KM: Yeah… yeah. I saw this man who was dealing with something he just did not understand. EH: Yes.KM: And I saw the fear….EH: Yes.KM: …in your face. It… it touched me personally. Um, my son is 14. Uh, he was 15 months when he was first diagnosed as being autistic. Being a father of a child who has autism, I don’t know what change is gonna occur in him. And, as parents, we’re there to help them deal with their obstacles. And if we can’t do it by ourselves, there’s other people out there to help. And I want to be one of those other people. EH: Well, nobody else does what you do. We looked like a very scary situation coming in there. And we turned into a, kinda, party, I think, people wanted to join. I’ve been in a lot of ERs. And some people have been kinda nice. I never sat there and felt like this is one of the most important moments of my life. KK: That was Ellen Hughes and Sergeant Keith Miller for StoryCorps in Chicago, Illinois.
