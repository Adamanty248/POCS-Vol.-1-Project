Greg Gibson (GG): My name is Greg Gibson. And I’m speaking with the man who killed my son.

Wayne Lo (WL): My name is Wayne Lo. I’m sitting here with the father of Galen, whom I murdered 25 years ago.

GG: How would you describe your mental state in those days?

WL: I was disturbed. I would see things that made me think that I was on some kind of a mission from God. But I know I wasn’t, now that I look back at–

GG: Sure, but at the time that was what you felt.

WL: At the time, that was.

GG: Yeah.

WL: At the time, I felt it. So, I felt I had to do something. I was able to just take a taxi and go to the gun store. I said I want this SKS rifle. And it’s incredible how easy it was.

GG: And the same, I assume, with the ammunition.

WL: I had my mom’s credit card. The people on the phone where I ordered from, they said, “Thank you very much for your purchase. We’ll get it out as soon as we could to you.” This was the first time ever purchasing a weapon, ever using a weapon, ever firing a weapon…

GG: Wow.

WL: For just a few minutes, I destroyed so many lives.

GG: For years you were in denial about the whole episode. And then at some point, you reached out to me. You said you wanted to apologize. What changed?

WL: Someone came to me one day with a magazine here in prison. And he said, uh, “Wayne, you might wanna read this.” And in the middle of it was an article where you had an interview. And it made me realize that there’s, there are families out there.

GG: Yeah.

WL: I didn’t know Galen personally at Simon’s Rock, but at the trial, you spoke about how you guys came on campus that time and came out of the car, and everybody gave Galen a standing ovation. I was there. I was there, Mr. Gibson, I was there. I didn’t know him, but I stood up, too… because I knew everybody loved him.

GG: Well we sure did. This is really exhausting, isn’t it?

WL: Yes, it is.

GG: You tell your parents that you’re having this conversation?

WL: Yes. Absolutely. I know they thank you just as much as I thank you for allowing me to, to even apologize to you. There are other families that don’t want to have anything to do with me and I totally understand that.

GG: Yeah, I do too. You know, we’ve all suffered, we’ve all grown wise from our suffering, and some people do it one way, some people do it another way. I understand that.

WL: I know that your family… perhaps they don’t agree with what you’re doing giving me the opportunity to speak. Is there ever a conflict within you that you’re doing something that might bother them?

GG: Yeah, I think it bothers my son. He just doesn’t want to have anything to do with it. He doesn’t want to talk about it. And I respect that completely. So yeah, I think they think I’m a little crazy. But they’re proud that I’m working for Galen so that people don’t have to keep doing this. I don’t think any of them would like to be here, with me, talking to you, no. And, that’s just the way, you know, that’s the way it is.
