\f1\b0 \'a0Avielle was not supposed to be in school that day. We had already made plans to go to New York City to see the Rockettes, but they were building gingerbread houses in the classroom that day, and she really wanted to go. I remember my phone rang with the emergency alert from the schools.\

\f0\b JR:
\f1\b0 \'a0It was just chaos, trying to figure out what was going on.\

\f0\b JH:
\f1\b0 \'a0I remember just searching and searching for her.\

\f0\b JR:
\f1\b0 \'a0We organized a list for families that couldn\'92t find their kids. There were 29 or so on there. They found a couple more kids that had ran, so that made it 26 and then it just stayed at 26. And so then I knew.\

\f0\b JH:
\f1\b0 \'a0You grabbed my shoulders and you looked me in my face and said, \'91I need to tell you this before you hear it from someone else, Avielle is probably dead.\'92 And I said, \'91I can\'92t leave until I see her. I\'92m her mom and that\'92s my job. I have to see her.\'92\

\f0\b JR:
\f1\b0 \'a0Yeah, we never got to see her. What do you miss most about Avi?\

\f0\b JH:
\f1\b0 \'a0The weight of her arms on my body when she\'92s hugging me. And her cheeks.\

\f0\b JH:
\f1\b0 \'a0It was hard for months, and it\'92s turned into years. And it\'92s hard all the time.\

\f0\b JR:
\f1\b0 \'a0I\'92m always thinking about this. Every waking moment, and a lot of times while I\'92m sleeping that it\'92s always there.\

\f0\b JH:
\f1\b0 \'a0How has Imogen\'92s birth changed you?\

\f0\b JR:
\f1\b0 \'a0I remember being really worried about, and I still am, what we\'92re going to do to explain to her\'85 she can walk around the house and see her sister\'92s pictures. How many little kids grow up visiting a gravestone?\
But I just remember being so happy that we finally were able to get pregnant and not have an only child, but to have two.\
What are your biggest fears about raising them?\

\f0\b JH:
\f1\b0 \'a0Even though it\'92s statistically not probable, I fear that they will be shot. But I\'92ve never really been ruled by fear. I will do my best to give them the tools to not live in fear.}
