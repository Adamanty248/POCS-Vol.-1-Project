\f1\b0 : I saw this guy with a hat. It was a green felt hat. And I looked at it and I said, \'91I want that\'92. And then one day I grew my beard and my moustache and all of sudden behind me I keep hearing, \'93leprechaun, leprechaun\'94 and I started to enjoy it. So I started to emphasize the leprechaunishness. Now as I go down the street, I get, \'93Top of the morning to ya. Where\'92s your pot of gold? Hey Mr. Leprechaun, give me some luck.\'94 And as I tell people that ask me if I\'92m a real leprechaun, \'91I\'92m the realest leprechaun you\'92re ever going to see in your life, man.\'92\

\f1\b0 : How has it changed your life?\

\f0\b JB
\f1\b0 : It\'92s given me a warped view of the world. Because everybody is happy when they see a leprechaun. One day I went down to the DMV and I stood on line, and I saw this person behind the counter giving everybody a hard time, and I gave her my paperwork, and she looked and it and said, \'93This is wrong. Next.\'94 And I said, \'91What\'92s wrong with it?\'92 \'93Next!\'94 So I went home and figured out what might of been wrong with it and I came back the next day, and she takes the paperwork and she says, \'93That\'92s wrong.\'94 But she looked up at me, and she got a big smile on her face. She said, \'93No, no, that\'92s alright.\'94 And she corrected what was wrong. And I got outside and I scratched my head, and when my hand hit my hat, I said, \'91that\'92s what happened, she saw the leprechaun and she changed 180 degrees.\'92\
Every couple of years I\'92ll go out without a hat and I\'92ll dig way down in the bottom of my closet and find something that isn\'92t green and wear it out just to see the different reactions from people. And all of a sudden people don\'92t want to meet your eye, don\'92t want to talk to you, because I\'92m so small that they\'92re afraid that they\'92re going to insult me if I catch them looking at me. But when I become the leprechaun they look and they say, \'93Well that guy doesn\'92t mind being looked at, I mean, he couldn\'92t possibly if he dresses like that.\'94\

\f1\b0 : What are the most important lessons you learned in life?\

\f0\b JB
\f1\b0 : Don\'92t take today too seriously. Things may look very bleak right now but they\'92ll be turned around. It\'92s just a matter of holding on until they do. I never planned on being a leprechaun. People don\'92t even know what a leprechaun is. Neither do I tell you the truth. But when something good is dumped in your lap, you take it.\cb1 \uc0\u8232

\f0\b TM
\f1\b0 : How do you keep his memory alive?\

\f0\b EL
\f1\b0 : Well. I have a lot of his clothes. I wear his t-shirts, his polo shirts, they\'92re all green. You know? I remember a lady came up to me and she said, \'93Are you the leprechaun\'92s sister?\'94 And I said, \'91Yeah. How do you know that?\'92 She said, \'93You look just like him.\'94\
But I really never realized how popular he was until he died. At the funeral\'96\

\f0\b TM
\f1\b0 \'a0: \'a0There were so many people there. I remember the mayor came.\

\f0\b TM
\f1\b0 \'a0: You know, the thing I really learned about life from him was basically: love thy neighbor. I think he made me kinder person.\

\f0\b EL
\f1\b0 : That\'92s a wonderful tribute. He was a great guy.}
