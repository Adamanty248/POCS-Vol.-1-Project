\f1\b0 \'a0I remember the first time my son said, \'92Mom, are you taking your big bag or your little bag?\'92 And that was his question of, \'92how long are you going to be gone for?\'92\

\f0\b Zoe Courville (ZC):
\f1\b0 \'a0Yeah.\

\f0\b LK:
\f1\b0 \'a0I had gotten my first grant. I went to the field, I cried the whole plane ride when I left and I missed his first Christmas, but when I got back, he snuggled right in.\

\f0\b ZC:
\f1\b0 \'a0So, I had my son in 2011, so you were the pioneer and I had to ask you a lot of questions. The biggest question I had was if your son remembered you when you came back after being gone.\

\f0\b LK:
\f1\b0 \'a0When you asked me that, I remembered thinking I didn\'92t necessarily have good advice.\
We\'92re scientists. We want data. And we don\'92t have that.\

\f0\b ZC:
\f1\b0 \'a0When I did get back home, my son didn\'92t recognize me. He sort of recoiled when I went to go have my imagined moment of us running into each other\'92s arms. You know, I wondered if I had done the right thing.\

\f0\b LK:
\f1\b0 \'a0Yeah.\

\f0\b ZC:
\f1\b0 \'a0I have had one instance that I still sort of struggle with. Someone I respect as a scientist immensely, unsolicited he said to me, \'92You know, I was in the field a lot and I was always grateful that my wife stayed home with the kids because kids need their mothers.\'92\'a0\
He very pointedly wanted to let me know he\'a0felt that\'a0that was important. But kids also need their fathers, and you don\'92t hear that a lot.\

\f0\b LK:
\f1\b0 \'a0I think I\'92m a better scientist because I\'92m a mother, because I work harder in the field. If I\'92m away from my children, there\'92s an extra weight that I have to do even better.\

\f0\b ZC:\'a0
\f1\b0 Just recently I wanted to do an extra trip to the South Pole and the way I had phrased it to my husband was, \'92You know, honey, they might need someone to go to the South Pole to drill some ice cores.\'92\
And my son actually piped up and he said, \'92Mommy, you can do that.\'92\
And so there was a moment where I felt like things would be okay, that my son actually understands what I do is important and is kind of proud of me.}
