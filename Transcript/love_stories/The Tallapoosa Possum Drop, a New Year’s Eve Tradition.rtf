\f1\b0 What do you remember about our first date?\

\f0\b Jackie Jones (JJ):\'a0
\f1\b0 Well, I got in the car and you said, \'92Now, don\'92t get excited, Jackie, but my pet snake is loose in this car,\'92 and I\'92m not a snake person.\

\f0\b BJ:\'a0
\f1\b0 But you toughed it out, didn\'92t you?\

\f0\b JJ:\'a0
\f1\b0 I toughed it out. You were a hot number for me.\'a0We dated for two years, and then we decided to elope.\

\f0\b BJ:\'a0
\f1\b0 I remember you didn\'92t want your mother and daddy to know where we going, so you threw your clothes out the window.\

\f0\b JJ:\'a0
\f1\b0 I did.\

\f0\b BJ:\'a0
\f1\b0 And just as we were getting ready to leave, Ivey Pope called and said he had killed a strange bird in his lake and wanted me to come and look at it. So we went over to Ivey Pope\'92s lake and he had just killed a duck.\

\f0\b JJ:
\f1\b0 \'a0And\'a0by then it was night and we had to go to the judge\'92s house and when we got there, he was drunk.\

\f0\b BJ:\'a0
\f1\b0 Well, he wasn\'92t exactly drunk, he was just kind of wobbling a little bit.\

\f0\b JJ:\'a0
\f1\b0 He was feeling real good.\

\f0\b BJ:\'a0
\f1\b0 Yeah, he was feeling good.\

\f0\b JJ:\'a0
\f1\b0 Well I must have been crazy in love to go through this.\
We seldom ever have an argument, but if it is, it\'92s about something like an elephant\'92s eye. But I\'92ll say right here that you do know a lot.\

\f0\b BJ:\'a0
\f1\b0 Well, I\'92ll be. I need to record that.\

\f0\b JJ:\'a0
\f1\b0 Tell me the story about Spencer.\

\f0\b BJ:\'a0
\f1\b0 There was this big possum on the side of the road. He wasn\'92t hurt at all, except he was dead. So, I said, \'92Well, he\'92ll make a nice mount.\'92 So I got out and mounted him hanging by his tail, and I never thought Spencer would be a celebrity.\
You know, Tallapoosa, before it was incorporated, used to be called Possum Snout. So the people, they said, \'92Let\'92s have a Possum Drop on New Year\'92s Eve.\'92\'a0We thought it was stupid\'a0but you just never seen such hollering\'85\

\f0\b JJ:\'a0
\f1\b0 They start cheering and carrying on\'85\

\f0\b BJ:\'a0
\f1\b0 Yeah.\'a0And they\'92ll knock you down to get over there and get a picture of Spencer.\

\f0\b JJ:\'a0
\f1\b0 People give you more credit for Spencer than anything else.\

\f0\b BJ:\'a0
\f1\b0 Well let me tell you. A\'a0man or a woman\'a0is blessed if they can go to work every morning and enjoy it. And I\'92m just really happy that I\'92ve had partner all of these years that I wouldn\'92t trade for anybody.\

\f0\b JJ:\'a0
\f1\b0 Thank you. Life has not been dull with you, Bud.\

\f0\b BJ:\'a0
\f1\b0 Well I know that, but when you got in the car that night, you should have known.\

\f0\b JJ:\'a0
\f1\b0 I know I did. That should have been my first clue as to what my life was going to be like.\

\f0\b BJ:\'a0
\f1\b0 Thank you, Jackie, and I love you.\

\f0\b JJ:\'a0
\f1\b0 I love you most.\
