\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 AM: How did you feel when you learned that Malik had autism?\
CJ: It was like a shot in the gut. I thought my son would be non-verbal, that he would never say I love you, but when he started talking he wouldn\'92t shut up.\
AM: What\'92s the hardest day you\'92ve had with Malik?\
CJ: It\'92s not his bad days that are hard, it\'92s my bad days that are hard. I remember when I started cutting his hair, I know the sound of that metal grinding scares him, and he\'92s fighting me. I got so frustrated, and I forced him, like I held his head, and I could see it hurting him. And then afterwards I broke down and then he came to me and he says, \'93Dad, don\'92t worry about it, I\'92ll be okay next time.\'94 It was a stain on my brain for a long time. And I\'92m working on it. I\'92m a work in progress.\
AM: I\'92ve learned, like patience, you\'92ve got to have it. In the beginning, just with my son was tough. Now you fast forward to having my daughter. And when she\'92s two, she gets diagnosed. Two kids on the spectrum. It\'92s like a heavy load, like picking up a mountain. And back then, I was in a shell, I wasn\'92t even explaining how I was feeling.Then there happened to be an autism event, and I seen you there with Malik. That was the first time we met.\
CJ: Yeah\'85\
AM: After that it\'92s been totally different. Just the fact that you\'92re not alone dealing with this. That right there changed my life, period. How do you think people see your son?\
CJ: Well, I\'92ve got to tell you, I have a lot of concerns for him. My son right now is 12 years old and he\'92s 5 foot 9\'94.\
AM: He\'92s tall.\
CJ: Yeah, he\'92s huge. And when he gets excited, he flaps his hands really hard\'96this is not abnormal, this is as normal as rain for him.\
AM: Right.\
CJ: But my fear for him has been that somebody sees him, and they interpret his body language as something that it\'92s not. So even with a smile on his face he\'92s going to be threatening to people.\
So let me ask you, Anthony, um, as a police officer, do you have concerns for my son?\
AM: You know, I do, yes. My son too.\
CJ: That\'92s why the best thing I can do is teach him what\'92s socially acceptable, and what can be misperceived as a problem. I hate to have to teach him those things, and I don\'92t want to take his innocence away either, but in time he\'92ll know. And you know what? Who he is today, I never thought he\'92d be, so I know there\'92s possibilities for him.}
