\f1\b0 \'a0The worker came in, she chatted a bit, the left some formula and said, \'92Here, here you go. Sign this paper.\'92 [laughs] And this little baby, he was so beautiful.\

\f0\b DB:
\f1\b0 \'a0I remember his first reaction when he saw you was that he smiled even though he was not in the greatest shape.\

\f0\b JC:
\f1\b0 \'a0He needed some food. He needed to gain some weight. And, uh, his cry, it was so wimpy. You know, he couldn\'92t belt it out. Eventually, he really found his voice. [laughs]\

\f0\b DB:
\f1\b0 \'a0He found his voice\'85\

\f0\b JC:
\f1\b0 \'a0Yes!\

\f0\b DB:
\f1\b0 \'a0Yes he did. Three and a half years he was with us. From nine months to almost four and a half years old.\

\f0\b JC:
\f1\b0 \'a0He was in essence our son. We loved him that way, we treated him that way.\

\f0\b DB:
\f1\b0 \'a0Do you remember the day that he went back?\

\f0\b JC:
\f1\b0 \'a0Yeah. How could I forget? And as much as I tried to prepare myself, there\'92s no way to prepare for that kind of thing.\

\f0\b DB:
\f1\b0 \'a0I remember getting the call from the caseworker that he had to go back, like, now. And I remember panicking. And I remember picking him up from daycare, and got home and had to pack his clothes and pack some toys. And I just remember being on autopilot and just sort of in shock.\

\f0\b JC:
\f1\b0 \'a0Yes. It was that way. It was hard to be in the house. Nobody would set foot in his room. It was sort of uh, the ghost of the kid that used to live there. It was a very sad place.\

\f0\b DB:
\f1\b0 \'a0So then we decided to do it again. [laughs] It was Thanksgiving weekend of 2012 when we got the call for the siblings, two years old and fifteen months old. And I remember just thinking\'85\

\f0\b JC:
\f1\b0 \'a0How can we not?\

\f0\b DB:
\f1\b0 \'a0How can you say no?\

\f0\b JC:
\f1\b0 \'a0Right.\

\f0\b DB:
\f1\b0 \'a0How has being a foster parent changed you?\

\f0\b JC:
\f1\b0 \'a0I think in some ways, having to love someone and then give them up makes you less demanding of other people, just generally speaking. I think the other thing is being a foster parent made me want to be a foster parent even more. It\'92s hard to lose kids, that\'92s for sure. But I can do this, and I can help them.\

\f0\b DB:
\f1\b0 \'a0I struggle with how they\'92ll, how, how they\'92ll remember us. I want them to remember that they were loved.\

\f0\b JC:
\f1\b0 \'a0Part of me doesn\'92t want them to remember us.\

\f0\b DB:
\f1\b0 \'a0Mmhmm.\

\f0\b JC:
\f1\b0 \'a0I want them to forget that there was some disruption in their life that caused them to have that family pulled apart. I want them to remember the loving, the warm feeling that they\'92re protected, they\'92re safe. But I, I hope they don\'92t remember us.}
