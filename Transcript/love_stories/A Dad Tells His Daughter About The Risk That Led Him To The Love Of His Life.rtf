\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 EC:
\f1\b0 \'a0The first night she went out with her friend, and they partied and then around 2 in the morning she called and said, \'93Could you get the key from my parents [chuckles] bedroom and come and pick us up?\'94 She was very naughty when she was young.\

\f0\b TC:
\f1\b0 \'a0[chuckles]\

\f0\b EC:
\f1\b0 \'a0She didn\'92t want her parents to know she was out that late I think. So I did that. And she was actually mildly impressed that I was able to do it. [laughs].\

\f0\b TC:
\f1\b0 \'a0Yeah you had to sneak into their bedroom while they were sleeping.\

\f0\b EC:
\f1\b0 \'a0It\'92s a skill you get to acquire in college [laughs]\

\f0\b TC:
\f1\b0 \'a0[laughs]\

\f0\b EC:
\f1\b0 \'a0We stayed up and we talked and talked and talked about everything. Until the sun came up. I thought, \'93wow\'94 you know, \'93she\'92s really something special.\'94 But I said, she\'92s way beyond what is within my reach.\

\f0\b TC:
\f1\b0 \'a0[giggles]\

\f0\b EC:
\f1\b0 \'a0But then I thought \'93you know if you don\'92t try, you\'92ll always regret it\'94. So I wrote her a letter, and that was the start of it.\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 She had her own mind about everything. And it was very unconventional.\

\f0\b TC:
\f1\b0 \'a0Yeah, she wasn\'92t afraid to state her opinions, but I think she had so much charm also.\

\f0\b EC:
\f1\b0 \'a0Yes. Yes. She had a very infectious smile. Sort of a half pixie-ish gleeful grin. And she had this gift to write that made it sound like she was talking to you on the page.\

\f0\b TC:
\f1\b0 \'a0Yeah, that\'92s why I\'92m so grateful she journaled all those years\

\f0\b EC:
\f1\b0 \'a0Yeah.\

\f0\b TC:
\f1\b0 \'a0\'91cause when I miss her I just read her journals and it \'97\

\f0\b EC:
\f1\b0 \'a0You can hear her voice.\

\f0\b TC:
\f1\b0 \'a0Yeah exactly.\

\f0\b EC:
\f1\b0 \'a0Yeah. But I guess one of the things that I think back on a lot is that, uh, when mama was around we had plans. Right? Oh let\'92s go retire in China or something like that. So, I think the worst part about losing mama is losing my own future in that sense.\

\f0\b TC:
\f1\b0 \'a0There are some pains that never go away. If I just think about the day she died or how I miss her, I cry immediately.\

\f0\b EC:
\f1\b0 \'a0The pain of the grief, that\'92s also a gift. Because when you stop grieving is when you start losing contact with the person. But as long as you can grieve for her, then she will always feel very close. And so for me, actually, I welcome it.\

\f0\b TC:
\f1\b0 \'a0Yeah\

\f0\b EC:
\f1\b0 \'a0Because then I feel much closer to her.\
