\f1\b0 We came here when he was 5 years old. And Diego started speaking English faster than we did. He was often letting me know, \'92When I finish high school, I\'92m going to join the Army.\'92\

\f0\b GR:
\f1\b0 \'a0Before he went to Iraq he got the green card. But he said to me, \'92Dad, don\'92t do the citizenship \'96\

\f0\b YR:
\f1\b0 \'a0\'96 Citizenship.\

\f0\b GR:
\f1\b0 \'a0\'96 Until I return. We\'92ll do it together.\'92\

\f0\b YR:
\f1\b0 \'a0The last time we spoke, he said, \'92I wrote you a letter, do not open it if you\'92re not ready.\'92 A week later, I got the letter, and it was different from the rest. He was talking about this feeling that he had that he was going to die. He asked for forgiveness for anything wrong that he had done, and he said that he loves me. This letter was like a bucket of icy water.\

\f0\b GR:
\f1\b0 \'a0And he died March 29.\

\f0\b YR:
\f1\b0 \'a0I remember I was sitting on the steps and the chaplain came into the house.\

\f0\b GR:
\f1\b0 \'a0He said, \'92Mr. Rincon, I\'92m sorry. Your son is dead.\'92\

\f0\b YR:
\f1\b0 \'a0I didn\'92t believe what they told us, so I called the Army and I asked for pictures of his body. I looked at the pictures and I destroyed them.\

\f0\b GR:
\f1\b0 \'a0Sometimes I wake up in the morning thinking that this is a nightmare, and he\'92s coming back. But I had my baby for 19 years and it was a blessing.\

\f0\b YR:
\f1\b0 \'a0Because of what happened to Diego there\'92s always that question,
\f2\i \'a0What if we hadn\'92t come here?
\f1\i0 \'a0But at least he was doing something with honor, with pride. He was doing something for America.\

\f0\b GR:\'a0
\f1\b0 And he got citizenship the day of the funeral. That is \'97 it\'92s something that\'85 it\'92s a piece of paper, but it means a lot for us. He always will be our hero.}
