\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 usan McClinton (SM): I came into the topless bar that you were bouncing to compete in amateur night\'97because there was a prize at the end. And at the time I had two children to support, so I needed the money. I remember at one point you said, \'94I\'92ll keep an eye on you.\'94\
Philip McClinton (PM): I thought, She doesn\'92t belong in here \'85she didn\'92t need to be in this place.\
SM: And I think that was the beginning of our relationship. You said, \'94I am going to take you rattlesnake hunting.\'94 I thought you were absolutely out of your mind, but I had so much fun, I thought, Hey this is something I might want to do on a regular basis. And I remember at one point telling you that I had always enjoyed science and school. And you said, \'94Well, why don\'92t we go back to school.\'94 And I said, \'94You\'92re crazy.\'94\
PM: Neither one of us had anything but a 9th grade education. I\'92d tried 10th grade three times, and I couldn\'92t cut it. And we didn\'92t think anyone would take us. And I said, \'94Call them and ask.\'94 And they accepted us on probation. We took all of our courses together.\
SM: You didn\'92t know anything about school. And I recall several times when you told me that you just didn\'92t think you could make it anymore. And I would always tell you, \'94I\'92ll get you through it.\'94\
PM: And we were both working on biology degrees.\
SM: Remember cell biology, I drew a diagram and taped it up in the bathroom on the mirror, so in the mornings you\'92d have to look and learn it from there.\
PM: Without your help, I\'92d have never gotten through this, because a lot of it I just plain didn\'92t understand. But I think the thing I am proudest of is that you finally did things that you never dreamed you could do. And you did them so well. You turned into a fine field biologist.\
SM: I guess I learned for the first time that I really was a person of worth. You know, after my life started out so bumpy, I never thought we\'92d get a college degree. And if you hadn\'92t come into my life, I think I would have ended up in a very bad place.\
PM: Yeah.\
SM: It was a rescue romance, is what we called it, because we saved each other.}
