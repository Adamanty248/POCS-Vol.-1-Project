\f1\b0 \'a0You placed an order over the phone and said, \'92Can you deliver some lunch to the funeral home?\'92 The door was unlocked, so I came in with meatballs marinara, and you were doing some kind of autopsy or something. And I remember I just stood there staring at you in your white gown with blood all over it.\

\f0\b GH:
\f1\b0 \'a0When you walked in I didn\'92t think anything of it.\

\f0\b LH:
\f1\b0 \'a0You were coming toward me with blood on your hands going, \'92It\'92s okay. It\'92s okay.\'92 [laughs] So I dropped the food and ran out of there.\

\f0\b GH:
\f1\b0 \'a0Uh-huh\'85\

\f0\b LH:
\f1\b0 \'a0But later on you asked me out to dinner. And, back then, every day you were on call.\

\f0\b GH:
\f1\b0 \'a0And then we got a call.\

\f0\b LH:
\f1\b0 \'a0We were at the restaurant. I was like, \'92I\'92ll wait here. I don\'92t want to go pick up a body.\'92 And you said it was nothing to worry about. I remember bringing the gurney in and you put it in the back of the van. We were driving and you stopped at the red light real quick. And then that gurney, and whoever was on there, rolled right up between us. Who feels like eating after that?\

\f0\b GH:
\f1\b0 \'a0Me?\

\f0\b LH:
\f1\b0 \'a0Oh my God.\

\f0\b GH:
\f1\b0 \'a0Well, he wasn\'92t going to dinner with us. I wanted to see if you would hang in there because that was my lifestyle. And if it would freak you out, then there was no reason to go any further.\

\f0\b LH:
\f1\b0 \'a0But that was the second date\'85\

\f0\b GH:
\f1\b0 \'a0Yeah\'85 Like a Band-Aid, right off\'85\

\f0\b LH:
\f1\b0 \'a0[Laughs] At that time a lot of women would have run for the hills. But I remember you said, .Hey, you want to go up to Long Island for a weekend?\'92 But you didn\'92t say that we were going to go to a military funeral. You came to pick me up in a hearse and you said, \'92We just got to go drop off the colonel, then we\'92ll have the whole weekend.\'92\
And when we did finally get to this cemetery, those gates opened, and you knew everything. You knew what to do and what to say to them and all of a sudden, I see you in a whole different way.\
To me, that was my weekend because after that it was like, how is he going to top this?\

\f0\b GH:
\f1\b0 \'a0They\'92re all special. That\'92s why I like doing an average person because that person\'92s not average to that family. And that\'92s why it\'92s so important when you make arrangements to listen \'97 you got two ears and one mouth, use them in proportion. Get them talking, so they\'92ll find that,\'a0
\f2\i Okay, I know I can live on.}
