\f1\b0 \'a0One day, my mother was braiding my hair. We were sitting at the kitchen table and my brother walked out the door with his baseball bat \'97 he was going to practice. I started crying and I said to my mother, \'92I\'92m just as good as him. I wish I could play.\'92 So she said, \'92Why don\'92t you just go and try out?\'92 And I said, \'92Okay, well cut off my braids.\'92 And she did. So I ran into my brother\'92s room, got a pair of his slacks, put on a baseball cap and signed up as Tubby Johnston.\

\f1\b0 \'a0When you found out you made the team, were you surprised that they called you?\

\f0\b KJM:
\f1\b0 \'a0No, I wasn\'92t surprised at all. I knew I was good and I had fooled them so far. But I was scared, of course, that they might find out and tell me I couldn\'92t play. So after several practices, I talked to the coach. His reaction was, \'92You\'92re such a good player and we\'92re going to use you at first base.\'92 I played the entire season. It was an absolutely thrilling time.\

\f0\b CM:
\f1\b0 \'a0The kids on the team you played with, how did they treat you?\

\f0\b KJM:
\f1\b0 \'a0When they found out I was a girl, the team treated me fine. It was the other players that would push me down or call me names. And the parents initially booed when I went out to play. They could see that I was a better player than some of their sons.\
After the season was over with, my dad went to a meeting with some Little League officials. And, um, when he came home, I said, \'92How did the meeting go, Dad?\'92 And he said, \'92Well, no girls, under any circumstances, will be playing Little League baseball.\'92 And it\'92s known as the Tubby Rule because I was the reason why they put that rule in.\
But I said to him, \'92You know Dad, someday I\'92m going to play first base on the New York Yankees.\'92 And he just gave me a big hug and he said, \'93I know you will, Kit Kat.\'94\

\f0\b CM:
\f1\b0 \'a0What gave you the courage to do what you did?\

\f0\b KJM:
\f1\b0 \'a0You know, I have to tell you, when I went out pretending to be a boy I had no idea I was setting some sort of a record. That was the furthest thing from my mind. I just wanted to play the game. I played Little League just that one year but I will probably love baseball until the day I die.}
