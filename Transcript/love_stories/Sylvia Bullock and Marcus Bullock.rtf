\f1\b0 \'a0That long road trip on that prison bus, it was like three or four hours. The whole time, I\'92m mentally preparing myself for warfare.\

\f0\b SB:
\f1\b0 \'a0Survival.\

\f0\b MB:
\f1\b0 \'a0Yeah.\

\f0\b MB:
\f1\b0 \'a0How did you cope with being a minister with a son in prison?\

\f0\b SB:
\f1\b0 \'a0You know, here you are trying to help everybody else, and you can\'92t even minister to your own. Because I felt like, \'92What could I have done differently? Um, how did I not see it?\'92\

\f0\b MB:
\f1\b0 \'a0I think that you did everything that you possibly could. You kept me in church Monday through Sunday.\

\f0\b SB:
\f1\b0 \'a0Ok, well \'97\

\f0\b MB:
\f1\b0 \'a0[laughs]\

\f0\b SB:
\f1\b0 \'a0\'97 being in church and being engaged with what you\'92re doing there is two different things.\

\f0\b MB:
\f1\b0 \'a0What was life like at home while I was gone?\

\f0\b SB:
\f1\b0 \'a0Well, initially it was a real sense of feeling alone. And I stop cooking dinner. But what kept me truly alive and focused was being able to write you.\

\f0\b MB:
\f1\b0 \'a0The letters were everything. The way that you wrote six-, seven-, eight-page letters to me\'85I would picture you writing and how your hands would be moving across the paper. You were really baring your soul to me. Before then, it was always like, \'92Hey, I\'92m your mom. Go put shoes on. Hurry up, Let\'92s go to church.\'92\

\f0\b SB:
\f1\b0 \'a0I remember, you know, talking to the wardens \'97\

\f0\b MB:
\f1\b0 \'a0\'97 You was such a mom \'97\

\f0\b SB:
\f1\b0 \'a0[laughs]\

\f0\b MB:
\f1\b0 \'a0\'97 What mother calls to the prison and talks to the warden?\

\f0\b SB:
\f1\b0 \'a0[laughs]\

\f0\b MB:
\f1\b0 \'a0\'97 like, this is not a guidance counselor in college \'97\

\f0\b SB:
\f1\b0 \'a0\'97[laughs] I was like, I need to talk to the warden, and you need to know that my son is here, he\'92s only 15.\

\f0\b MB:
\f1\b0 \'a0You became less of my authority figure mom and became more of my caring and concerned mom. \'a0That\'92s what kept me alive. Because a year out here is not the same thing as a year in there. A year in there is just the same day, every day, over and over and over again. And, and because they send me to these prisons where people had so much more time than I had to serve, in my mind I\'92m like, \'92I got eight years, oh my gosh, what am I going to do.\'92 But in their mind they\'92re like, \'92I potentially may die in prison. You\'92re going to go home one day. Why are you acting like you have my kind of time? You don\'92t have my kind of time, Marcus. Do your eight years, go home, and make us proud. Like, if you can\'92t make it out there, than none of us can make it.\'92\

\f0\b MB:
\f1\b0 \'a0So when you look at me today, what do you see?\

\f0\b SB:
\f1\b0 \'a0I see a young man who said that, \'92I\'92m going to change the world.\'92 I see a man who loves his children, and his wife. And I am thankful that you have grown up to be the person that you are today.\

\f0\b MB:
\f1\b0 \'a0I\'92m honored to be able to say that I had that direction from you, and you being that mom in my life so \'97\

\f0\b SB:
\f1\b0 \'a0I love you too.\

\f0\b MB:
\f1\b0 \'a0Thank you.\

\f0\b SB:
\f1\b0 \'a0[laughs]\

\f0\b MB:
\f1\b0 \'a0I love you, Mom.}
