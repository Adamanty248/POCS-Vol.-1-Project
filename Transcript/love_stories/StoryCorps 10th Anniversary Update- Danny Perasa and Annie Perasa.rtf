\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 DP: She started to talk, and I said listen I\'92m going to deliver a speech and I said at the end you\'92re gonna want to go home. I said you represent a dirty four letter word, I said that word is love. I says if we\'92re going anywhere we\'92re going down the aisle because I\'92m too tired, too sick and too sore to do any other damn thing. And she turned around and she said, of course I\'92ll marry you. And the next morning I called her as early as I possibly could \'96\
AP: And he always gets up early \'96 (Laughs)\
DP: \'96 to make sure she hadn\'92t changed her mind, and she hadn\'92t. And every year on April 22 around three o\'92clock, I call her and ask her if it was today would she do it again, and so far the answer\'92s been the same.\
AP: Yeah, twenty -five times yes. (Laughs)\
DP: You see, the thing of it is, I always feel guilty when I say I love you, to you, and I say it so often, I say it to remind you that as dumpy as I am, it\'92s coming from me- it\'92s like hearing a beautiful song from a busted old radio. And it\'92s nice of you to keep the radio around the house.\
AP: If I don\'92t have a note on the kitchen table, I think there\'92s something wrong. You write a love letter to me every morning\
DP: The only thing that could possibly be wrong is that I couldn\'92t find a silly pen.\
AP: To my princess, the weather out today is extremely rainy, I\'92ll call you at eleven twenty in the morning \'96\
DP: It\'92s a romantic weather report.\
AP: -And I love you, I love you, I love you.\
DP: When a guy is happily married, no matter what happens at work, no matter what happens in the rest of the day, there\'92s a shelter when you get home, there\'92s a knowledge, knowing that you can hug somebody without them throwing you down the stairs and saying get your hands off me. Being married is like having a color television set, you never want to go back to black and white.\
AP: The illness is not hard on me; it\'92s just, you know, the finality of it\'96and him, he goes along like a trooper.\
DP: Listen, even downhill a car doesn\'92t roll unless it\'92s pushed and you\'92re giving me a great push. The deal of it is, we try to give each other hope and not hope that I\'92ll live, hope that she\'92ll do well after I pass, hope that people will support her, hope that if she meets somebody and likes \'92em, she marries \'92em.\
AP: Yeah, he has everything planned, you know.\
DP: I\'92m working on it. She said it was her call. She wants to walk out behind the casket alone. I guess that\'92s the way to do it because when we were married, you know how your brother takes you down, your father takes you down? She said, well, I don\'92t know which of my brothers to walk in with, I don\'92t want to offend anybody. I says I got a solution, you walk in with me, you walk out with me and the other day I said who\'92s gonna walk down the aisle with you behind the casket, you know, to support her and she said nobody; I walked in with you alone. I\'92m walking out with alone.\
AP: Mm hmm.\
DP: There\'92s a thing in life where you have to come to terms with dying. Well, I haven\'92t come to terms with dying yet. I want to come to terms with being sure that you understand that my love for you up to this point was as much as it could be and it\'92ll be as much as it could be for eternity. I always said the only thing I have to give you was a poor gift and it\'92s myself, and I always gave it, and if there\'92s a way to come back and give it, I\'92ll do that too. Do you have the Valentine\'92s Day letter there?\
AP: Yeah. (AP Reads Note) AP: My dearest wife, this is a very special day. It is a day on which we share our love which still grows after all these years. Now that love is being used by us to sustain us through these hard times. All my love, all my days and more. Happy Valentine\'92s Day.\
DP: (Crying) I could write on and on about her. She lights up the room in the morning when she tells me to put both hands on her shoulders so that she can support me. She lights up my life when she says to me at night, wouldn\'92t you like a little ice cream or would you please drink more water. I mean, those aren\'92t very romantic things to say, but they stir my heart. In my mind and my heart there has never been, there is not now and never will be another Annie.}
