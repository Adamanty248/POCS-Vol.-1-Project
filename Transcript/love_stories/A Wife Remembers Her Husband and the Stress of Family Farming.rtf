\f1\b0 Farming was the family tradition. And even though he went to college and he studied to do something else, Matt just felt that that was where he needed to be. Maybe not where he wanted to be, but it was where he needed to be.\
And the day that he died, that morning, he said to me, \'92I feel paralyzed. I can\'92t make decisions.\'92\
I\'92m thinking, \'92This is normal stress. This is springtime. If we could just get through the planting, we\'92d be okay.\'92\
But he didn\'92t come in for dinner, and it started to get dark.\
Then, my phone rang and it was Matt. I said, \'92Where are you? It\'92s dark and I\'92ve got dinner ready and you\'92re tired. Why don\'92t you come home?\'94\'92\
And he said, \'92I love you.\'92 We always said that, always. And I said, iI love you too.\'92 That was the last conversation that we had.\
He was at the place where he died when he called me.\
He left a letter to me that was very beautiful, kind of a love letter. And he said twice in that letter, \'92I think you should have Trent farm for you.\'92\

\f0\b Trent Andrews (TA):\'a0
\f1\b0 It was very humbling for me to read the words that Matt wrote, and I think about it a lot.\
You know, it\'92s really hard for farmers to ask for help. I\'92ve always compared it to one person taking care of an 18-hole golf course by themselves. And when you get down, your instinct is to work harder, and a lot of times, that\'92s not the right thing to do.\
How did you feel about me taking over the farm?\

\f0\b GP:\'a0
\f1\b0 You know, it\'92s funny, I\'92m not a real mechanical person, but I knew the sounds of Matt\'92s tractors. A farm wife sort of knows that. And I could always hear Matt\'92s tractor coming down the road. And I remember the first time that you came, Trent, with the tractor, and it wasn\'92t Matt on it. So.\
I\'92ve read a lot of different definitions of grief, and one of them I really like is, \'92Grief is love with no place to go.\'92\
But you just never let me be alone very long. And you looked out for me and quite\'a0often I ask, you know, \'92How are you?\'92 And then, \'92How are you really?\'92 Um.\

\f0\b TA:\'a0
\f1\b0 You do ask that a lot.\

\f0\b GP:\'a0
\f1\b0 Because I am concerned. In some ways you and Matt were quite alike.\

\f0\b TA:
\f1\b0 \'a0But, when you think about Matt Peters, you don\'92t think about suicide. I mean, just,\'a0a lot of times before I make a decision I will ask myself, \'92What would Matt have done?\'92\
He was an excellent farmer and\'a0everyone respected him. I\'92ve told you that before, but I want you to know that one more time.\

\f0\b GP:\'a0
\f1\b0 Thank you. He was my everything.\
