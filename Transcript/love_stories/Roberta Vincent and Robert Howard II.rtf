\f1\b0 \'a0I was four at the time and I remember not crying at the funeral.\'a0\

\f0\b RV:
\f1\b0 \'a0I can\'92t imagine that you even knew what was going on.\

\f0\b RH:
\f1\b0 \'a0I thought it was a magic show.\

\f0\b RV:
\f1\b0 \'a0Really?\

\f0\b RH:
\f1\b0 \'a0Yeah\'85 Seeing him, and then, when they draped the flag, all of a sudden the casket is closed. I\'92m like,\'a0
\f2\i Where did he go?
\f1\i0 \

\f0\b RV:
\f1\b0 \'a0I remember you writing a paper about him in third grade; but the paper was written\'a0as if he was still here. So I remember sitting down, talking to you, and you cried; I cried.\

\f0\b RH:
\f1\b0 \'a0It kind of made me angry, especially coming from a small town where everybody knew my father but me. I just felt cheated.\

\f0\b RV:
\f1\b0 \'a0I could see you struggling but I didn\'92t know how to help you. And I would\'a0envision that God would take me and bring your dad back, because, at that time, you\'a0needed him more.\

\f0\b RH:
\f1\b0 \'a0That\'92s something you never told me, Ma.\
You know, I went through a lot of turmoil. And as I grew older, drugs were a way for me to escape; and I really didn\'92t care whether I lived or died at that time. So I kind of put the blame on him. I used to say to myself,\'a0
\f2\i Well things would be different if you were here.
\f1\i0 \
And then I was sleeping one night. I was having a dream and this dream was\'a0real vivid. There was a whole bunch of bodies on the ground and I was looking for my father\'92s body. And I know he was there; but I couldn\'92t find him. So I think he was trying to wake me up then. And I knew I had to \'a0go to Vietnam for me to lay him to rest.\'a0\
I used to wear that medallion that I had created with his picture etched in gold. I\'a0carried it around like it was a part of me; I never took it off. But, when I got to Vietnam, that\'92s when I took off the medallion. And when I took that chain off, I felt a sense of relief. I didn\'92t have to carry him anymore.\

\f0\b RV:
\f1\b0 \'a0You certainly have walked in your dad\'92s footsteps. You honor him daily. I know that he is proud. And I love you dearly.\

\f0\b RH:
\f1\b0 \'a0I love you, too, Ma, and I thank you for sticking it out with me.}
