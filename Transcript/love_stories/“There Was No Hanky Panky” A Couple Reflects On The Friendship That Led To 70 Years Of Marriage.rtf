\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Joel Helfman (JH):
\f1\b0 \'a0I was playing stick ball.\'a0\

\f0\b Julia Helfman (FJH):\'a0
\f1\b0 I was reading a book.\'a0\

\f0\b JH:\'a0
\f1\b0 You caught the ball, and I came to retrieve it.\'a0\

\f0\b FJH:\'a0
\f1\b0 You were the skinniest boy I\'92d ever seen.\'a0\

\f0\b JH
\f1\b0 : And I thought to myself, \'92What a hot babe.\'92\

\f0\b FJH:\'a0
\f1\b0 (Laughs.) Did you really?\'a0\

\f0\b JH:\'a0
\f1\b0 And the rest is almost history.\

\f0\b FJH:\'a0
\f1\b0 We became fast friends.\

\f0\b JH:
\f1\b0 \'a0And that\'92s all we were\'85\'a0\'a0\'a0\

\f0\b FJH:
\f1\b0 \'a0That\'92s right. There was no hanky panky, there was no writing my name next to yours\'85 How come you never made a pass at me?\

\f0\b JH:
\f1\b0 \'a0You were really beautiful, but you were above fooling around\'85\'a0I left home for Chicago when I was about seventeen and a half \'85\'a0\

\f0\b FJH:\'a0
\f1\b0 Right.\'a0\

\f0\b JH:\'a0
\f1\b0 I wrote to you and said I was coming back to New York for a week. And I would love to see you.\

\f0\b FJH:\'a0
\f1\b0 Right.\'a0\

\f0\b JH:
\f1\b0 \'a0Were you enthusiastic about it?\

\f0\b FJH:\'a0
\f1\b0 No.\

\f0\b JH:
\f1\b0 \'a0Oh\'85 ok.\'a0\

\f0\b FJH:
\f1\b0 \'a0I said, \'92Well, he\'92s been gone over a year and I haven\'92t even gotten a postcard.\'92 And my mother said, \'92He\'92s such a nice boy. You always enjoy being with him.\'92 So I thought, \'92Well, I\'92ll listen to my mother.\'94\'92\

\f0\b JH:
\f1\b0 \'a0So I came back and we saw each other every day and then we were walking home in the park\'85.\

\f0\b FJH:\'a0
\f1\b0 Thursday night\'85\

\f0\b JH:\'a0
\f1\b0 And you stopped and said \'97\

\f0\b FJH:
\f1\b0 \'a0I\'92ll say what I said.\

\f0\b JH:
\f1\b0 \'a0Go ahead.\

\f0\b FJH:
\f1\b0 \'a0I said, \'92How much do you like me \'97 a little or a lot?\'92 You said \'97\

\f0\b FJH and JH:
\f1\b0 \'a0\'92A whole lot.\'92\

\f0\b FJH:
\f1\b0 \'a0And I said, \'92I like you more than any other male except my Papa.\'92 And then I looked at you and I said \'97\

\f0\b JH:
\f1\b0 \'a0\'92What are we gonna do about it?\'92\

\f0\b FJH:\'a0
\f1\b0 And what did you say?\

\f0\b JH: \'92
\f1\b0 We could get married.\'92\

\f0\b FJH:
\f1\b0 \'a0And I said, \'92Let\'92s.\'92\'a0We had never even kissed, we had never held hands. So, you walked me up the five flights of stairs and then you gave me a kiss on the lips, and that was enough for me. I went into the apartment and I said, \'92Papa. I\'92m going to get married.\'92 He said, \'92No, you\'92re not! You\'92ve got a brain, you\'92re gonna make something of yourself.\'92 And I said, \'92Papa, there\'92s just something about him that just makes me feel I can do things. I know we can build a great life together. I just know it, Papa.\'92 And my father looked at me and he said, \'92I have never doubted your judgment. If this is what you want, I support you in it.\'92 And that was that.\'a0\

\f0\b JH:
\f1\b0 \'a0We\'92re happy, right?\

\f0\b FJH:
\f1\b0 \'a0(Sigh.) Everyday I look at you and I say to myself, \'92How was I smart enough to know that this, this young man would always keep me happy\'85 always make me feel safe\'85\'a0always challenge me?\'92\

\f0\b JH:
\f1\b0 \'a0And there\'92s no one that comes anywhere near close to you.\

\f0\b FJH:\'a0
\f1\b0 Oh my God, honey. We\'92re both lucky. And I think this is done because what more can we say?\

\f0\b JH:
\f1\b0 \'a0Mm-hmm (affirmative).\

\f0\b FJH:\'a0
\f1\b0 Unless I leap across this table and just hug and kiss you. (Laughs.)\
