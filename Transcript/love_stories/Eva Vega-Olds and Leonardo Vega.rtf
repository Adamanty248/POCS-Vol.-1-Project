\f1\b0 \'a0When I was recording my dad, I was in his bedroom that he shared with my mom. There was the hospital bed in there, he had an oxygen machine, and he was struggling to breath, but I said, \'93Dad, do you want to do an interview?\'94 And he said, \'93Let her rip,\'94 and so we did.\

\f1\b0 \'a0My family\'92s the kind of family that if you can\'92t take sarcasm, forget about it. Like my wedding day, I remember walking down the aisle, and my dad was walking like super slow. And I\'92m like, \'93Dad!\'94 And he says to me, \'93Shhh, it\'92s my day. I finally get rid of you.\'94\

\f1\b0 \'a0When we took him home, he came back to hospice care and the nurses were there. He looked at me and he said, \'93I think they think I\'92m gonna die.\'94 And I said, \'93Well, if you feel differently then do differently.\'94 But every day he got weaker and closer to the end.\

\f1\b0 \'a0I did the interview Tuesday afternoon and he passed on Thursday night. You know, not for nothing but my dad\'92s a working class fellow, he bought a home, paid off his home, and was able to die in his home, with his family around him. For him, that was the pinnacle of what your life should be. And I think that he did achieve his dreams}
