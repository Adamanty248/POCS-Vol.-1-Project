\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 SS: I vividly remember there was a lot of happiness and joy in Eastern Afghanistan. If there was a wedding, the entire village would show up. And you felt very welcomed to go into each other\'92s homes, and we knew who had what for dinner every night and if we didn\'92t like what we had for dinner, we all went to the neighbor\'92s house\'85\
JS: (laughs)\
SS: So, um\'85\
The summers are very, very hot. Everyone slept on the rooftop. And I vividly remember this old lady next door to us that would talk every night about her grandson\'97a student in the United States. That\'92s when I heard the name of a country called America. I kept thinking, you know, I\'92m gonna figure out a way to get to this faraway magic land someday. Then Afghanistan basically plunged into a long civil war. And, uh, my father wanted me to leave the country because he knew that things are gonna get worse. \'a0\
JS: So what did you do for work here?\
SS: One Sunday, I came to this restaurant. I walk in there and the dishwasher hadn\'92t shown up and the manager asked me, when can I start, and I said right away. \'a0I did that for a few months and he moved me on as a\'97I became a cook\'97and then assistant manager. \'a0\
After that we opened the restaurant, and we\'92ve treated every single customer as if they are a part of our family. \'a0We have many regulars that eat three meals a day in our restaurant. \'a0And if they don\'92t show up, we call them to make sure they\'92re okay. And we go to their funerals, we go to their weddings. These people put shoes on my children\'92s feet and they deserve the best. So, we should turn around and give something back every single chance we get. \'a0\
You know, my grandmother, she knew that most of the village did not have enough to eat. \'a0So whatever we had for dinner every night, she made sure that she\'92ll have a plate full that I had to carry to different homes.\
So when I was in a position to give something back, we thought on Thanksgiving Day we\'92re going to open our doors to anybody and everybody. Last year, for instance, we had over 800 people that come to the door. \'a0We\'92re very, very lucky. And I don\'92t take that for granted at all.}
